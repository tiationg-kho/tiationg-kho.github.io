## Encapsulation

- Protect and control access to data
- Access Modifiers
    - Java provides several access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, and methods
    - `public`
        - Can be accessed from any other class
    - `protected`
        - Can be accessed from its own package or subclasses
    - default (no keyword required)
        - Can be accessed from its own package
    - `private`
        - Can be accessed only from its own class
- Getter and Setter Methods
    - We can use `public` getter/setter methods to access/modify the `private` variables
