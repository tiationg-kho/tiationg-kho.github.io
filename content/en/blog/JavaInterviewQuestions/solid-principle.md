## SOLID Principle

- Single Responsibility Principle
    - A class should have only one reason to change
- Open Closed Principle
    - Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle
    - Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of a subclass
- Interface Segregation Principle
    - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use
- Dependency Inversion Principle
    - Both high level class and lower level class should depend on abstractions
