500 solutions for LeetCode problems in Python and Java 17 notes on essential concepts related to data structures and algorithms 130 patterns for solving LeetCode problems greedy intro greedy algorithms is to pick the locally optimal solution at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum dp vs greedy in dp, we solve overall problem by combining the solutions about subproblems in greedy, we make a series of localized optimal choices without considering the overall problem pattern greedy we need to make the locally optimal choice sometimes, use sorting or heap can help us make greedy choice</description></item></channel></rss>
